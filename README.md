# Helium UI Library

This library provides a collection of Javascript UI components.
The components are based on the Webcomponents technology found in modern browsers.

# Repository Structure

The project root contains various config and build files:
- `shell.nix` - Defines the shell environment for Nix based development
- `packages.json` - Contains the `npm` project definition with its dependencies and tasks
- `packages.lock.json` - Contains unique identifiers for all `npm` project dependencies
- `rollup.config.mjs` - The config file of Rollup bundler
- `playwright.config.js` - The config file of the Playwright testing framework
- `jsdoc.config.js` - The config for the JSDoc documentation generator

All source files can be found in the `src` directory. 
Each components consists of a Javascript and CSS file.

The bundled javascript files meant for distribution are loacated in the `dist` and `dist-min` directory.
`dist-min` contains the minified files for production usage, while `dist` contains the same files unminifed for development/testing.
Both directories contain further subdirectories of the different library versions.
New code is always bundled into `latest`.
This allows users to choose an older, more stable versions for specific applications.  
The bundled files are Javascript files only, with the CSS packages inside.
Each file contains a single component, but may reference other components as import.
In the `dist` directory, for each component, two files are generated, one including a content-based hash and one without.
The version with hash is used to avoid caching issues, while the one without hash simplifies local development and testing.

The `tests` directory contains the test cases for the Playwright test framework.
The tests for each components are stored in their own subdirectory.

# Development Environment

Requirements:
- Git
- NodeJS (`npm`)

## Setup

Clone this repository:
```sh
git clone https://git.digitalweb.at/vawa1/helium-js.git
```

In the project root, run the following command to install the NodeJS development dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

Then, download the browser engines for the Playwright testing framework:

```sh
npx playwright install
```

After that, the installation processs is done.

## Usage

To run a local webserver for development, use:
```sh
npm start
```

Then connect to the webserver with your browser under the URL
```
http://localhost:8080/<path to index.html>
```

To run all test cases, use:
```sh
npm run test
```

Playwright also provides a graphical interface to work with tests:
```sh
npm run test-ui
```

# Development Guidelines

This section lays out some basic ground rules for contributing to this project.
This is necessary to ensure functionality and maintainability.

1. Variable names should be camel case (e.g. `myVariableName`)
1. Dollar signs `$` are put before variable names **only** if it contains a `HTMLElement` (e.g. `let $button = document.createElement('button')`)
1. Callback functions are pre-fixed with `handle`, followed by the event name (e.g. `handleClickSubmit()` or `handleInputItemSearch()`)
1. CSS variables use the following format: `--<element name>-<specifier>-<css attribute name in camel case>` (e.g. `--he-button-backgroundColor`, `--he-button-hover-backgroundColor`, `--he-dialog-title-fontSize`)
